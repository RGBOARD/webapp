<h2 align="center">Interactive LED Matrix Communication System</h2>

This project is a dynamic, web-managed communication system designed for the IEEE Computer Society at the University of Puerto Rico, Mayagüez Campus (UPRM). 

The goal is to improve how organizations communicate with members by replacing static methods (like flyers and whiteboards) with a modern, real-time digital display. Using a Raspberry Pi, the system shows announcements, events, and member-generated visuals in a compact and eye-catching format.

It features a user-friendly web application for content uploads and scheduling, an admin portal for content moderation and user management, and a backend system that validates and queues display content. This solution enhances member engagement, promotes sustainability by reducing paper use, and fits in small spaces where TVs are impractical.
